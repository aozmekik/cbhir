## Content Based Hyperspectral Image Retrieval with Deep Neural Networks

### *@drh0use*


Along with the developing remote sensing and hypespectral imaging systems, many
image archives have been collected, and many systems that contain this growing
hyperspectral image space have been developed. Providing fast image search and
access on rapidly growing hyperspectral image archives has become a great need.
In the project, based on this need, aim is to realize content based image retrieval on
the hyperspectral image collection. Existing methods in the literature were examined
and experiments were carried out with deep learning methods, considering that
hyperspectral images have rich spectral information.


In the study, deep networks with 2D and 3D CNN architectures were developed to
evaluate the bands in hyperspectral images, some deep network architectures
developed for hyperspectral data in the literature were implemented and scores were
obtained on the AnkaraHSI dataset. Scores are presented in comparison with
reference studies.


As a result of the study, the performance scores in the reference study were
increased as expected with the developed models and the experimental results were
recorded.
